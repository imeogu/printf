# Tasks done

  
**0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life**

Write a function that produces output according to a format.

**1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't**

Handle the following conversion specifiers: d, I  

**2. Just because it's in print doesn't mean it's the gospel**

Create a man page for your function.

**3. With a face like mine, I do better in print**

Handle the following custom conversion specifiers:
b: the unsigned int argument is converted to binary

**4. What one has not experienced, one will never understand in print**

Handle the following conversion specifiers: u, o, x, X

**5. Nothing in fine print is ever good news**

Use a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call write as little as possible.

**6. How is the world ruled and led to war? Diplomats lie to journalists and believe these lies when they see them in print**

Handle the following conversion specifier: p.

**7. My weakness is wearing too much leopard print**

Handle the following custom conversion specifier
S : prints the string.
Non printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed this way: \x, followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case - always 2 characters)

**8. The big print gives and the small print takes away**

Handle the following flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers:

"+"
"space"
"#"

**14. Print is the sharpest and the strongest weapon of our party**

Handle the following custom conversion specifier:
r : prints the reversed string

**15. The flood of print has turned reading into a process of gulping rather than savoring**

Handle the following custom conversion specifier:
R: prints the rot13'ed string
